`async-arp` is an asynchronous Rust crate that provides a high-level client for interacting with the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). It can be used to probe the presence of hosts in a network or send advanced, custom ARP requests. This crate is ideal for network diagnostics, monitoring, or any application requiring interaction with ARP.

## Features

- **Async & Extensible**: Uses the Tokio runtime for efficient asynchronous networking, with plans to support other async runtimes or a runtime-agnostic implementation.
- **Host Probing**: Quickly probe for active devices in the network using ARP requests.
- **Advanced Requests**: Send custom ARP requests and interact with devices in more complex ways.
- **ARP Caching**: ARP responses are cached for a customizable duration, reducing redundant network requests.
- **Retry capabilities**:  Improves reliability when probing hosts with intermittent responses.
- **Unix-only**: This crate is designed for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS, BSD).

## Requirements

This library requires elevated privileges to access raw network interfaces. You can either:

1. **Grant the program the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability** (recommended):
   
   This allows the program to run without `sudo` while still being able to access raw network interfaces. It's a more secure option than running the entire program as root.

   To grant the necessary capability, use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip /path/to/your/program
   ```
2. **Run the program with sudo privileges**
